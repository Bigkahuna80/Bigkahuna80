Hey everyone, 

I'm Chris

I'm interested in learning how to design my own apps and interactive websites to help support my family 
Would love any advice or if anyone is interested in a partnership i have 25 plus years of
Sales and Marketing along with 8 years as a Recruiter for the United States Army. 
I might not have the tech knowledge but I definitely can sell anything and understand 
What it takes to put it in the correct lanes to maximize profitable outcomes to have a substantial profit margin .
    So if you have the experience in building/tech but not profiting enough to make it 
Your only income source let's talk. I'm all about making a partnership where we both are financially 
Secure for our families all the way thru our golden years in today's day n age punching the clock is
For the sheep I know I was a sheep for almost 30 years now and due to some live changing events
I've made the decision to stop making other people wealthy and happy 
I'm going to make my money work for me and obtain the  financial security my family deserves to have 
So if you'd like to make things happen and ready to Rock n Roll reach out let's chat ya never know when
Your gonna meet the right person that changes your entire life in massive ways I'm hoping that 
Person regularly comes thru the hub. 
Open to talk to anyone about anything love to make new friends 
And see where it leads us. 
Hope you all have a wonderful day and a blessed 2022  !!
Stay safe,
